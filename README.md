# Humana AI/ML DevOps Platform Demo

Governance-first AI/ML DevOps demo with GitOps, DORA metrics, and multi-cloud CI/CD (AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem).


This repository demonstrates a governance-first AI/ML DevOps platform designed for regulated, enterprise environments. It showcases standardized CI/CD pipelines, GitOps-based deployments, DORA metrics, KPI dashboards, and security/compliance controls across on-prem and multi-cloud Kubernetes platforms (AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE).

The goal of this project is to illustrate how Lead DevOps Engineers can enable fast, reliable, and compliant delivery of AI/ML services at scale.
